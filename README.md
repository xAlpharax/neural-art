# neural-art
Neural Style Transfer done from the CLI using a VGG backbone and presented as an MP4.

Weights can be downloaded from [here](https://m1.afileditch.ch/ajjMsHrRhnikrrCiUXgY.pth). This is done to put as little strain as possible on github. The downloaded file should be placed in `./weights/`

### Why use this in 2023 ?
Because style transfer hasn't changed drastically in terms of actual results in the past years. I personally find a certain beauty in inputing an image with a desired style rather than a well curated prompt with a dozen of switches.
